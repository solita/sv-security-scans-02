# OPRFs: Oblivious Pseudorandom Functions
### (Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing)

## 1. 'Random' Functions

Let `F` be the set of all functions that take a variable-length 
input and produce an output of a fixed size. 
Even if we bound the maximal length of the variable-size input, 
the mere number of such functions is *N<sup>M</sup>*, where 
*M* and *N* are the sizes of domain and codomain.

If we could pick a function at *random* from `F` 
we could call it a *random function*, but the size of `F`
is so big and there is no way to pick at random from `F`.
Also, some/many functions are so complicated that they cannot
be described by a succinct algorithm, only by an explicit
enumeration of the values for all inputs.

We can emulate picking restricted random functions by 
the so-called pseudorandom functions (PRFs). 
HMAC (Hash-Based MAC) and most practical MACs (Message Authentication Codes) 
are such constructions. 
They are randomized by a key argument. Choosing 
a different key is like picking a random function.


## 2. MACs and PRFs

1. A MAC (Message Authentication Code) is a two-argument function 
   `F(k, m)` that takes two arguments:
   a fixed size key `k`, a variable size message `m`, and produces a fixed-sized
   message authentication tag as output.

1. There are several MAC implementations, including HMAC (Hash-based MAC),
   based on double hashing, and
   KMAC (Kessak MAC). KMAC is more modern, based on the SHA-3 family of 
   hash functions, and more efficient, based on a single hashing.

1. KMAC is a simple prefix PRF (PseudoRandom Function):
   ```
   F(k, m)=sha-3-*(k|m), where | is concatenation and * stands for 224, 256, 384, 512 
   ```
   (output length is the same as the number of bit in a `sha` function used.)

1. How many different KMAC functions are there (upper bound)? Not so many:
   one per key, total `2^|k|` (but `2^512` is abundant for any practical 
   purposes). This big number is negligible compared with the number of all
   possible MACs. Indeed, if we consider all MACs for messages of length 512 into
   authentication tags of the same length, then both domain and co-domain
   are of size `N=2^512`, and the total number of functions is 
   `N^N=(2^512)^(2^512)`, way bigger than `2^512` of KMACs. 
   And this is only for a fixed input size. Therefore, there are lots of MACs
   which are not KMACs. Similarly, any particular MAC implementation (e.g., HMAC)
   covers just a small portion of all possible MACs.

1. Why PRFs are called PRFs? Take some HMAC or KMAC `F`.
   When you pick a random `k` and fix it, you get a 
   **random** one-argument function `lambda m: F(k, m)`.
   It is not really random, therefore it is called **pseudorandom**.

1. Recall salted hashing. You may pick the sha-3-based KMAC above, but
   name the parameters differently:
   ```
   F(salt, pwd)
   ```
   Now by randomizing `salt` you pick pseudorandom hash functions, individual 
   per each user/salt.


# 3. OPRFs: Oblivious PRFs

1. As a motivating example, let us consider the case when you want to turn a simple 
password like `Abba` into a complicated password. Naively, I can use a hash 
function `f` and use `k=f('Abba')` as a key. Sure, this key may look random, but 
if you use it for encryption `enc(k, 'The winner takes it all')` it can be easily 
recovered by exhaustive brute-force search of short passwords.

2. As an alternative, you may use the encryption key 
`k=F(key, 'Abba')` with a KMAC `F`, quite a long (e.g., 256-bit) random `key`. 
This protects you from the brute-force attacks, but how do you remember a long
`key`? You will need to copy it between your devices. All this just confirms the 
wisdom that every problem in cryptography turns out to be key management.
The simplicity of your simple passwords is compensated by the complexity of `key`.

3. Here come OPRFs. Suppose you are Client `C` with your simple `pwd` and 
   there is server `S` which keeps complicated `key`. Jointly you want to
   compute a complicated `k=F(key, pwd)` in a way that:
   - `C` (you, Client) gets `k` but don't learn `key`, which may be reused 
     for several Clients if needed;
   - `S` (server) does not learn neither `pwd` nor `k` (i.e., learns nothing).
   
4. Magic? You delegate memorizing a complicated `key` to the server and then 
   use it in blind to help you compute `k=F(key, pwd)` without revealing
   your `pwd` nor encryption key `k`, nor you learn secret `key`.
   

## 4. OPRF Protocol

Let us now sketch how the magic above it possible. All computations are 
modulo a large prime `p` in the multiplicative group 
*Z<sub>p</sub><sup>*</sup>* *= {1, ..., p-1}*.

1. Client: your secret *pwd* in binary is an element of *Z<sub>p</sub><sup>*</sup>*.
1. Client: generate a random blinding *r*, in secret.
2. Client: compute *pwd<sup>r</sup>* and send it to the Server.
1. Server: cannot recover *pwd* from *pwd<sup>r</sup>*. Why?

## 5. OPRF for Envelope Encryption

**Envelope encryption** consists in:

1. using frequently generated data encryption keys (DEK)
2. encrypting *data* with a DEK, *enc(DEK, data)*
3. keeping encrypted data together with the DEK encrypted
   with a root key (RK), usually kept in a KMS:

   *<enc(RK, DEK), enc(DEK, data)>*

4. To decrypt you first decrypt DEK using RK and then use DEK for data
   decryption.

All major clouds use envelope encryption.

What are weaknesses of envelope encryption?

1. you send your DEK to KMS for encryption;
2. you receive your decrypted DEK from KMS;
3. as a result you DEKs are 'known' t KMS;
4. the communication channel (HTTPS) between your application 
   and KMS may be compromised.

**OPRF for secure envelope encryption.**

Let us use some unique identifiers for out DEKs, for example, 
random UUIDs.

Consider the OPRF protocol (described above) for computing *F(RK, DEK-id)*
initialized by Client who needs a DEK for data encryption.
Client sends a unique newly generated *DEK-id* to the KMS, 
KMS knows RK only. As a result of the protocol, KMS learns nothing, Client does not learn RK,
but gets the *DEK=F(RK, DEK-id)* which it uses for encryption.
KMS does not learn DEK! Also, any man-in the middle sniffing 
traffic between Client and KMS learns nothing!

Client encrypts and stores

*<DEK-id, enc(DEK, data)>*

For decryption, Client uses DEK-id to replay the OPRF for learning DEK,
and uses it to decrypt. (Since different blinding is used for different
protocol runs, the usage of DEKs are untraceable.)

We see that the OPRF-based envelope encryption is more secure than the
traditional one.
